## What are "Generative Adversarial Networks"? (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are designed to generate new data that is similar to a set of training data. It makes use of two neural networks that are trained together in a competitive setting against each other.

One neural network called the generator network creates sample data. And the other network called the discriminator network, distinguishes between real training data and the fake data created by the generator network.

During the training phase each new AI network needs to go through, the generator network produces fake data and the discriminator network tries to determine if each sample is real or fake. Throughout this process the generator network is updated on how well it did on generating fake content, and the discriminator is updated on how well it was able to distinguish between real and fake.
