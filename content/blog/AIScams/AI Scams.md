# 🤖 AI Phone Call Scams Targeting ARE Targeting Australians 🤖

Impersonating Australian businesses, these scammers take legitimate sales employees voices, and with the use of AI tools, generate automated conversations that reply to your questions.

These calls are fully automated, requiring no human intervention but sound almost like you're speaking to real person.

With the addition of phone call quality sounding horrible already, it may be hard for the untrained ear to pick up on.

## 📚 How do I stay safe?

If you feel like you're talking to an AI, simply ask it very detailed questions several times, and you will be able to pick up on the response it gives.

These AIs are still not very "intelligent", so anything outside of its programming structure will cause it to either hang up the call or respond with something generic.

## 💰 What are these scams trying to accomplish?

They will ask for personal information for various use cases, not limited to your address, first and last name, phone numbers, card and bank account information.

Their main objective is to gain access to your finances, so they can extract money from your accounts.

## 🏫 How do we counter this?

It's extremely imported to talk to friends and family, spreading awareness on these topics is the number one way to cause change in mindset and attitude in our behaviours.

As well as enabling spam protection on your mobile device, and avoiding unknown caller IDs.

## 👨‍💻 What does the future behold?

Now that we live in the AI age, this technology along with the associated scams are only going to get more advanced.

Now is the time to stay vigilant and proactively learn about emerging threats, and how we can remediate against them.
