Where to start.. so much has happened in the cyber security space in the last few months :thinking:.

Lets start with the second largest telecomunications company in Australia, Optus.

Over 10 million Australias had their drivers license/passport number leaked to a hacking forum. The forum acts as a mediatory for confirming legitamcy of the exploit used and eventually selling of stolen data to other cyber criminials.

<u>What can we learn from this?</u>

Should we be storing such critically identifying information of customers on systems that can be accessed via the public internet?

Ironically business and enterprise customers were not affected, why are these customers more important than retail?

Many questions that I personally would like answered but unfortunately Australian data privacy laws need to catch up to the twenty first century.
