## Grammar and punctuation 

Make sure your Resume doesn’t contain spelling or punctuation errors.
Not only does it look unprofessional, but ATS systems will not see your keywords.
 
Make your key facts known and achievements highly visible. You should be able to see them immediately.

Proofread your resume at least 10 times! You will always find areas to improve.

## Layout & Positioning

Put your newest and highest achievements at the top of your Resume. 

These should be projects that made an impact on the organization. Use numbers and key facts to display your points.

Recruiters spend on average 7 seconds per Resume, you need to show value in under 7 seconds.

You need to stand out, grab the attention of the person reading your resume immediately.

Here’s a heat map from a recruiter looking at Resumes. You can see in red where they look the most. Then after the main headings are seen, the dot points are noticed less.

This demonstrates that is it critical to provide high value dot points first.

## Graphics and ATS

Don’t include pictures. Include only text throughout your resume.

Your Resume will go through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) first before a real human view it.

Pictures can cause ATS to break leading to your resume getting flagged and never making it to a real person.

## Applicant Tracking Systems

Ensure your Resume matches multiple keywords in the job description.

Hit keywords multiple times to ensure the ATS system identifies your Resume as a match.

Use straightforward headings, Professional Summary, Qualifications, Education, Career Summary

Many ATS systems are configured to recognize these heading names. Cross the path of least resistance and allow the ATS system to easily find information and not get confused.

## Contact Information

Include your contact information at the very top next to your name.

This is the time to drop the TrickShotKing@hotmail.com email address you have had since you were 12.

Your email should be your [firstname.lastname@youremailprovider.com]

Bonus point for having your own domain.
[contact@firstnamelastname.com] or [contact@yourbusinessname.com]

Look professional, first impressions count!
