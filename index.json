Deadman alerts could be set up if movement is not detected within a certain threshold, to trigger an alert for a welfare check.\nSecurity systems could benefit from the added data points, such as already avaiable PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors.\nHow it works # Body tracking technology already exists with LiDAR and radars, but those sensors cost thousands of dollars.\nIt works by using Channel State Information from WIFI Routers. These are complex decimal sequences which donâ€™t have spatial coordinates.\nThe raw CSI signals are cleaned by amplitude and phase sanitation.\nThen a neural network performs a translation to 2D feature maps that resemble images.\nThese are given to a modified DensePose-RCNN architecture, Developed by Facebook and London researches, to estimate a UV map.\nAs you can see in this video, a 3D representation of the person is generated by the AI.

Firstly what is FTX and Alameda Research? And how do these tie into each other?\nFTX: # Before there demise this crypto exchange was the second largest by volume traded everyday and best in its class for derivative products for traders. Their slogan was \u0026ldquo;FTX\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;For The Traders\u0026rdquo;. Gaining traction in the industy as the best and gaining rights to the miami heats stadium plus SBF the CEO regularly visiting DC in the US meeting with the SEC regarding regulatory policies. The colapace of this company came to surprise everyone in the industy, but looking back there were warning signs everyone passed off as the founder being intrinsic.\nAlameda Research: # Was a quant prop crypto trading firm specialising in arbatriage trading. And were on the the first crypto trading firms to take advantage of the different in bitcoin price from country to country.\nHow do these 2 companies connect? # So unlike TradFI, CEX\u0026rsquo;s in crypto need to have the actual crypto on hand as there is a limited supply of each coin unlike fiat currency. They were running the CEX like a fractunial reserve where you do not need to have all cash on hand at all times. But unlike TradFI, in crypto you cannot just print more BTC, ETH etc. So what happened was Alameda was taking funds from the FTX crypto exchange to use for trading allowing them to generate greater returns. But what happens when they start losing on trades and are unable to pay back the orginial money they took? Well nothing yet as everyone trusts that FTX would never do this. But one people started to find out and rumours of insolvantcy started to spread we begain to see a classic bank run start. FTX saw a rise in withdrawls, the most they had ever seen in one day, 5 billion. But that was it, after that they had no more funds to send out to clients. Now if this occured with a major bank like JP Morgan the Central Bank aka the FED would step in and just print some more cash to bail the bank out - like we saw in 2009 with multiple banks. This did not occur as how can you print more cryptocurrency? The whole point of cryptocurrency is that there is a finite reserve of it which drives price action and scarity of the asset.\n","date":"15 November 2022","permalink":"/blog/ftx/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Crazy story this one.","title":"FTX and Alameda Research"},{"content":" ","date":"26 October 2022","permalink":"/consultation/","section":"Kaya Rezende","summary":" ","title":"Consultation"},{"content":" ","date":"26 October 2022","permalink":"/resume/","section":"Kaya Rezende","summary":" ","title":"Resume"},{"content":"Useful git commands.\nPull from remote github: # git pull Setup local git instance: # git init Push to github: # git add . # Add files to repo git commit -m \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Commit files to local repo git push -u origin main git push ","date":"25 October 2022","permalink":"/blog/basic-git-commands/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Useful git commands.","title":"Basic Git commands"},{"content":"Projects in progress: # Online Cyber Security Learning platform Completed Projects: # Moodle LMS setup on AWS kayarezende.com website ","date":"24 October 2022","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Kaya Rezende","summary":"Projects in progress: # Online Cyber Security Learning platform Completed Projects: # Moodle LMS setup on AWS kayarezende.","title":"Projects"},{"content":"Where to start.. so much has happened in the cyber security space in the last few months ðŸ¤”.\nLets start with the second largest telecomunications company in Australia, Optus.\nOver 10 million Australias had their drivers license/passport number leaked to a hacking forum.
